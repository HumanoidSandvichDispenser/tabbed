 Serhan's dwm

## This build mainly includes these features

* Live reloading colors from Xresources on fly with `kill -s USR1 $(pidof tabbed)`.
* Hiding tabs on key release.

And many more customizations, tiny features and optimizations. I tried to make all these features highly customizable on fly with live Xresources reloading.
